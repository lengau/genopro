## Install

To install this snap, run

    sudo snap install genopro
    
from your terminal. This will install a GenoPro application icon, and upon first run it will automatically download and install the appropriate Visual C runtime for wine and GenoPro.

Please note that you will need Internet access on the first run of the application.

[![Get it from the Snap Store](https://snapcraft.io/static/images/badges/en/snap-store-white.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/genopro)

([Don't have snapd installed?](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install))

## Additional tools

The snap also makes the commands `genopro.wine` and `genopro.winetricks` available. The former allows one to run Windows executables in the GenoPro wine environment and the latter allows use of winetricks within that same environment.

## Remaining tasks

Snapcrafters ([join us](https://forum.snapcraft.io/t/snapcrafters-reboot/24625)) are working to land snap install documentation and the [snapcraft.yaml](https://github.com/snapcrafters/fork-and-rename-me/blob/master/snap/snapcraft.yaml) upstream so GenoPro can authoritatively publish future releases.
